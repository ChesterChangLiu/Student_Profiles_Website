# Student_Profiles_Website

This is a frontend application by using React.js

# Description

The app uses a public API to retrieve student data and shows a summary of each student's information. Adding tags to students and filtering by tags, as well as filtering by student first and last name, are all features that may be used to edit the data. The create-react-app toolchain was used to construct this project, which combines HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.

# Instructions

git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git
npm install # or yarn install
npm start  
  
The app should be running on http://localhost:3000 or whichever PORT number you specify.
  
Check your react-script dependency is avaliable or not in package.json.
If not available then add it manually via:
npm install react-scripts --save
